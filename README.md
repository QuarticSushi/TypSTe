# TypSTe
TypSTe (typing speed test) is a typing test program am making so that if I can't connect to the internet i can still practice typing.

--- plan ---

reads a sentence from a text file and prints >> 
starts a timer and the user types the sentence >> 
stops the timer and calculates wpm >> 
saves wpm to text file

--- later features ---

I might add these in later, but no promises

accuracy 

gui - using pygame (probably not) 

sentence generator

speed / accuracy visualisation (matplotlib?)
